Licensed under a disjunctive tri-license giving you the choice of one of
the three following sets of free software/open source licensing terms:
 - Mozilla Public License, version 1.1 or later;
 - GNU General Public License, version 2.0 or later;
 - GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later.
This allows the use of the code in as wide a variety of software projects
as possible, while still maintaining copy-left on the code I wrote.
